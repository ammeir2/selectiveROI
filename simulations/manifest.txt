001 -- intial experiment, varying the tykhonov slack exponent [COVERAE RATE CALCULATED INCORRECTLY]
002 -- exprimenting with different boundary imputation methods [COVERAE RATE CALCULATED INCORRECTLY]
003 -- experimenting with both tykohonov slack exponents and imputation methods, corrected the way 
coverage is computed.
004 -- experiments with different tuning parameters
005 -- more tuning, changing samples per iteration
006 -- experiments with running multiple MC chains when sampling at profile likelihood estimate
007 -- experiments using updated API, with power estimation.
008 -- experiments with Robins-Monroe CI computation routine
009 -- like 008, varying the number of iterations
010 -- like 009, varying some parameters to see if coverage rate can be improved without major software changes.
